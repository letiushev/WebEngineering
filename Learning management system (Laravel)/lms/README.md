The task is to implement the functions of the following learning management system (LMS).

There are two types of users in this LMS: teacher and student. As a teacher we have the following options:

    to create a new subject
    to view the details of a subject (CRUD)
    to create a new task within the subject
    to view the details of a task (CRUD)
    to view the solutions for a task
    to evaluate the solutions for a task

The student can do the following tasks:

    to take a subject
    to leave a subject
    to view the details of a subject
    to view the tasks for a subject
    to submit a solution for a task

The task is implemented as a Laravel application using a local SQLite database. The tables are filled by migration and seeded with a few data.
